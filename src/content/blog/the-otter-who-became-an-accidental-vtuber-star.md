> Chester is the creation of Kris Yim, an animator who told Polygon over email that they are working on a virtual reality movie starring the very same character. They came up with the concept back in 2016 as a part of a school project, but it took years for them to find a good venue to tell Chesterâ€™s story.
>
> When Yim graduated from school, they figured why not use some of that free time streaming on Twitch? Over the course of two weeks, Yim constructed Chesterâ€™s model using Live2D Cubism â€” the process, they say, is similar to rigging a character for TV animation.
>
> They were never expecting people to latch on so quickly to Chester, which was mostly being used as a test of their animating capabilities. Alongside the actual model, Chester sometimes also has props like a guitar, or outfits, like a maid apron, which make periodic appearances on the stream.
